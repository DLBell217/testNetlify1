            Rubik's Cube Solving: my story
        </h1>

        <p class="text-lg mb-5">
            My fascination with Rubik's Cubes started at an early age. I put countless hours into finding a way to solve them.
          And for a time, that was all I could do. I struggled and turmoiled, each turn of the cube seeming so good, but ultimately falling short.
          
        </p>

        <p class="mb-5">
            After a while, I grew tired of feeling inept. I decided the internet would be where I made my final stand. Searching through the countless articles, I finally found hope.
          A simple website, the name of which is lost in the sands of time, gave me what I wanted. There were six steps to solving a cube, all I had to do was learn them.
        </p>

        <p class="mb-5">
            It took a week to memorize the steps. At first, I struggled to solve the cube in under 10 minutes.
          Now, I can do it in under 1 minute. Years of practice and learning shortcuts has honed my skills to a comfortable position.
          A far cry from the best, but satisfactory for me.

          Chess was a similarly life long endeaver. I played it with my father as long as I can remember. 
          I didn't really start getting into it until around 2020, when I found the GothamChess YouTube channel.

        <p class="mb-5">
            Now, I am the "President" of the SUNY Oneonta Chess Club. We aren't officially recognized, but that was our choice.
            I play a whole lot on Chess.com. I also enjoy doing chess puzzles as frequently as I can.

        <p class="mb-5">
           I also have played Videogames all my life. The first console I played on (never had a good computer) was a playstation. 
          With which I played Tekken as well as a selection of racing games. My first console was a ps3, on which I played fallout New Vegas, Mortal Kombat XL, and Call Of Duty (The Modern Warfare trilogy and the Black Ops series).
          I now own a ps4 and ps5 where the variety of games I play on them is extensive. I also own a Nintendo Switch and a 3ds.
